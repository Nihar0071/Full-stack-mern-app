# Online Real Estate Marketplace

## Introduction

Welcome to our Online Real Estate Marketplace, a comprehensive platform designed for buying, selling, and renting properties. Developed using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js), this application offers an interactive and user-friendly interface for real estate transactions. Whether you're looking to purchase your dream home, sell a property, or find the perfect rental, our marketplace caters to all your real estate needs.

## Features

- **User Authentication**: Secure signup and login functionality for users.
- **Property Listings**: Users can view, post, and manage listings for sale and rent.
- **Search and Filter**: Advanced search options to filter properties by location, price, type, etc.
- **Property Details**: Detailed property pages with images, descriptions, and contact information.
- **Favorites**: Ability to save favorite properties for easy access later.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: React.js for a dynamic and responsive user interface.
- **Backend**: Node.js and Express.js for server-side logic.
- **Database**: MongoDB for storing user data and property listings.
- **State Management**: Redux for managing application state across components.
- **Styling**: CSS and Material-UI for modern and stylish design.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have Node.js and npm installed on your machine. To check, run the following commands:

```bash
node --version
npm --version
```

### Installation

Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Nihar0071/Full-stack-mern-app
cd mern-estate-main
```

Install the necessary npm packages for both the client and server:

```bash
# Install server dependencies
npm install

# Navigate to the client directory
cd client

# Install client dependencies
npm install
```

### Running the Application

To start both the server and client at the same time (from the root of your project), use:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This command concurrently starts the backend server and the React frontend in development mode, opening up the application in your default web browser.

## Usage

- **View Properties**: Browse the listings on the homepage.
- **Sign Up/Login**: Access user-specific features like adding listings or saving favorites.
- **Add Listing**: Post a new property for sale or rent through the user dashboard.
- **Search**: Use the search bar and filters to find properties that match your criteria.
